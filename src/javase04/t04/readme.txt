Make film collection. Save it to file using serializable interface and load it back.

I tried to make a little bit over. So accidentally actor and film classes hasve some features that never used.


To make it work run "Try.java" (or Try class from console =)

Genre is enum of film genres
Actor and film are classes
FilmCollection is a set of films and actors with some add/delete features
FilmCollectionEditor is just class with save and load FilmCollection methods
Try as were said above is the only class with main method
